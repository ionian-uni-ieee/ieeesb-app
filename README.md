# IEEE Web application

A IEEE Student Branch Dashboard & Management tool for student branches of the IEEE Organization.

## Why

Members and the community of IEEE Student Branches will be able to advertise and interact with the community itself in an easier way. This application intends to tie the community in a much tighter form and shape a more robust social construct.

Its more important aspect is the fact that the student branch can advertise the SB's events. This means that the community will be more self-aware, more people will know about the SB's events and advertisment will be easier and more effortless.

**In short: We spread knowledge, we make new friends and we meet people we haven't met before in a much more easy way.**
